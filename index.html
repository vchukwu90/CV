        <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="https://www.manunited.com/">Scalable Science</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I spent four years of my University life in libraries and lecture halls. Books and lecturers bombarded me with fine chemical theories, equations and reactions. I also wrote some beautiful chemical equations myself.</p>
        <p>Stepping into the brewing industry, I have since discovered how meaningless those theories are!</p>
        <p>Here at Scalable Science, I want to share with science graduates (and soon-to-be-graduates) what is really obtainable in large scale industries.</p>
        <p>If you are a science graduate searching for a job, if you are in your final year in the university, if you are already working in an industry where a little science is applied in your job role, you need to keep up with Scalable Science as I share my journey.</p>
